# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

- `LinkedList`: A directory containing implementation of a singly linked list.
- `Stack`: A directory containing implementation of a stack using arrays.
- `Queue`: A directory containing implementation of a queue using linked list.
- `Sorting`: A directory containing various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quick sort, etc.
- `Searching`: A directory containing various searching algorithms like binary search, linear search, etc.

## How to Run

Each directory contains a `main.c` or `main.cpp` file which can be compiled and run to test the data structure or algorithm.

For example, to compile and run the LinkedList implementation:

```bash
gcc LinkedList/main.c -o output
./output
